## Shopify

!> As [announced by Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/payments/hosted-payment-sdk), Shopify planned to deprecate the previous payment integration platform (Hosted Payment SDK) by July 31st, 2022. Shopify has urged Midtrans (and other payment gateways) to migrate to their new [Payment Platform integration](https://shopify.dev/beta/payments-apps/). In compliance with it, Midtrans is currently migrating to the new platform.
\
\
Unfortunately **currently during the migration, you may not be able to integrate Midtrans** to your Shopify store just yet. The new integration is **almost ready!** Our team is currently prioritizing in ensuring that it will run smooth, secure, & reliable as ever. 
\
\
We **will announce & update this docs as soon as Midtrans is publicly available** to be integrated to your Shopify store (before July 31st 2022). We apologize for the delay & any inconvinence.
