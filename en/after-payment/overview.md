# Getting Notified of Payment Status
<hr>
You can get notifications when the payment is accepted successfully on Midtrans, so that you can process the customer order accordingly. Once the payment process is completed by the customer, Midtrans sends notification to you. Alternatively, you can actively retrieve the transaction status from the Midtrans side. You can access transaction notifications in any of the following ways.
