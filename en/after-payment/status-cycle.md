<!-- TODO: create status diagram similar to this https://docs.woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/woocommerce-order-process-diagram.png -->

The table given below describes the life cycle of *Transaction Status* and its possible changes.


### Transaction Status

Transaction Status | Description | Possible changes(s)
--- | --- | ---
`pending` | Transaction is created and available/waiting to be paid by customer at the payment provider (ATM/Internet banking/E-money app/store). | settlement, <br>expire,<br>cancel, <br>deny 
`capture` | Transaction is successful and credit card balance is captured successfully. <br/>If no action is taken by you, the transaction will be successfully settled on the next day and transaction status will change to *settlement*.<br />It is safe to assume a successful payment. | settlement, <br />cancel 
`settlement` | Transaction is successfully settled. Funds have been received. | refund, chargeback, partial_refund, partial_chargeback
`deny` | The credentials used for payment are rejected by the payment provider or Midtrans Fraud Detection System (FDS). <br/>To know the reason and details for denied transaction, see the `status_message` field in the response. |
`cancel` | Transaction is cancelled. Can be triggered by Midtrans or merchant themselves.<br>Cancelled transaction can be caused by various reasons:<br> 1. `Capture` transaction is cancelled before Settlement.<br> 2. `Challenge` Transaction is denied by merchant. |
`expire` | Transaction no longer available to be paid or processed, because the payment is not completed within the expiry time period. |
`failure` | The transaction status is caused by unexpected error during transaction processing. <br/>Failure transaction can be caused by various reasons, but mostly it is caused when bank fails to respond.<br/>This occurs rarely. |
`refund` | Transaction is marked to be refunded. Refund can be requested by Merchant. | 
`chargeback` | Transaction is marked to be charged back. | 
`partial_refund` | Transaction is marked to be partially refunded. | 
`partial_chargeback` | Transaction is marked to be partially charged back. |

<summary><b>Notes When Using Snap API</b></summary>
<article>

When a transaction is created on Snap API, it does not immediately assign any payment status on *Core API GET Status* response. Even if the payment page is activated on Snap API, you might encounter `404` or *Payment not found* response while calling *Core API GET Status*.

This is because the customer did not yet choose any payment method within the Snap payment page (idling or abandoning the Snap payment page). Once the customer proceeds with a payment method, then the transaction status is assigned and is available on *Core API GET Status*.

### Fraud Status

| Fraud Status | üîç    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `accept`     | ‚úÖ    | Transaction is safe to proceed. It is not considered as fraud. Refer to [Accepting Fraudulent Transaction](en/after-payment/dashboard-usage.md#accepting-fraudulent-transaction) for more details. |
| `deny`       | ‚ùå    | Transaction is considered as fraud and is denied/rejected for security reasons. For more information, refer to [Denying Fraudulent Transaction](en/after-payment/dashboard-usage.md#accepting-fraudulent-transaction). |
| `challenge`  | ‚ö†Ô∏è    | Transaction is flagged as potential fraud, but cannot be determined precisely. <br> You can accept or deny via Dashboard, or via [Approve](https://api-docs.midtrans.com/#approve-transaction) or [Deny](https://api-docs.midtrans.com/#deny-transaction) API.<br />If no action is taken, the transaction is denied automatically. |
