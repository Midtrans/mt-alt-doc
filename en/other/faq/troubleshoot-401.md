![401 Unauthorized Overview](./../../../asset/image/faq/auth-401-illustration.svg)

After submitting an API call to Midtrans, it is possible to receive HTTP 401 Unauthorized error code response. This article discusses ways to troubleshoot a 401 (unauthorized) error code.

## What is the 401 Error Code?
The 401 (Unauthorized) error code indicates that the merchant serverâ€™s request was not verified. When accessing the Midtrans API, 
your backend sends a request, which in this case was not verified. You will receive a simple message telling you that the 
request is unauthorized, like the sample bellow.

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### **Response 401 Snap**
```json
{
   "error_messages": [
      "Access denied due to unauthorized transaction, please check client or server key",
      "Visit https://snap-docs.midtrans.com/#request-headers for more details"
   ]
}
```
#### **Response 401 Core API**

```json
{
   "status_code": "401",
   "status_message": "Transaction cannot be authorized with the current client/server key.",
   "id": "2e3d5c81-f80c-4aed-a40c-1298b4abfd93"
}
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

This means that an incorrect Server-Key/Client-Key are being used or server-key and client-key being used in the 
incorrect environment. In order to verify the request, you need to use it with valid server-key and client-key.

## How to Fix the 401 Error Code?

The 401 Unauthorized error can be fixed by using any of the following ways:

1. Check Server-Key and Client-Key: 
   - Ensure that the **server-key and client-key are being passed correctly**. Please copy directly the value of server-key and client-key [from Midtrans Dashboard.](/en/midtrans-account/overview.md#retrieving-api-access-keys) 
   - Ensure there are **no spaces** at the start or end of your server-key and client-key. 
   - Check that your Apps/Backend **authenticating for the correct environment**. The credentials for Sandbox and Production are unique.

2. Check The Endpoint API URL and Correct Environment:
   - Sandbox and production are separate environments. **Make sure that you are not mistakenly executing your request in the incorrect environment.**
   - **Use the correct URL for your environment**, See Sandbox base URLs and Production base URLs for more information.
